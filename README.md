# Bash Exercises
This repository is to hold bash practice exercises.

From "Bash Scripting and Shell Programming (Linux Command Line)" By Jason Cannon

Ex 1 - 8

## Exercise​ ​1:
Write a shell script that prints "Shell Scripting is Fun!" to the screen.

Hint 1:

Remember to make the shell script executable with the chmod command.

Hint 2:

Remember to start your script with a shebang!

## Exercise​ ​2:

Modify the shell script from exercise 1 to include a variable. The variable will hold the contents

of the message "Shell Scripting is Fun!".

## Exercise​ ​3:

Store the output of the command "hostname" in a variable. Display "This script is running on

_______." where "_______" is the output of the "hostname" command.

Hint:

It's a best practice to use the ${VARIABLE} syntax if there is text or characters that directly

precede or follow the variable.

## Exercise​ ​4:

Write a shell script to check to see if the file "/etc/shadow" exists. If it does exist, display

"Shadow passwords are enabled." Next, check to see if you can write to the file. If you can,

display "You have permissions to edit /etc/shadow." If you cannot, display "You do NOT have

permissions to edit /etc/shadow."

## Exercise​ ​5:

Write a shell script that displays "man", "bear", "pig", "dog", "cat", and "sheep" to the screen with

each appearing on a separate line. Try to do this in as few lines as possible.

Hint: Loops can be used to perform repetitive tasks.

## Exercise​ ​6:

Write a shell script that prompts the user for a name of a file or directory and reports if it is a

regular file, a directory, or other type of file.

Also perform an ls command against the file or directory with the long listing option.

## Exercise​ ​7:

Modify the previous script so that it accepts the file or directory name as an argument instead of

prompting the user to enter it.

## Exercise​ ​8:

Modify the previous script to accept an unlimited number of files and directories as arguments.

Hint: You'll want to use a special variable.
